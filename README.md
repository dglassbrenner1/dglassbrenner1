## 🔍 About Me

- Proven track record with 21 awards for innovative analyses and cross-functional collaboration.
- Rare combination of deep mathematics and statistics with applied machine learning experience, providing a comprehensive analytical toolkit.
- Experienced across the full data analysis lifecycle: formalizing ambiguous objectives, addressing data challenges (reporting lag, missing data, rare events), resolving analytical issues (confounding, uncertainty), and translating results into big-picture implications.
- Passionate about using custom statistical and analytical solutions where cookie-cutter or "Stats 101/AI" approaches fall short.

## 🧪 Focus Areas & Interests

- Fraud detection: combining supervised ML with advanced statistical methods for better predictions and deeper insights.
- Custom data analyses: hypothesis testing, experimental design, uncertainty quantification, and complex sample designs.
- Safety and risk analysis: vehicle safety, rare-event modeling, and impact estimation.
- **Tools: Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib), SQL, Tableau**
